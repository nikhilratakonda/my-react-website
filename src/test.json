          "summary": "This is a fantastic site showing the unusual photographic project “Humans of New York” realized by Brandon Stanton. His goal was to photograph New Yorkers on the street and create an exhaustive catalog of city residents. The project itself turned into a blog that tells the stories of the heroes of this project. The work also finds in two best-selling books: Humans of New York and Humans of New York: Stories. See for yourself how a brilliant idea can turn into one of the best blogs.",
          "content": "1. “We have a cabinet in our apartment called The Witch Cabinet; its full of knick-knacks: tarot cards, random rocks, bottle caps, buttons; theres a whole beaver skull in there. Our walls are covered in murals. Our windowsills are covered with random bunches of dried flowers that we meant to put in jars. She could describe the relationship better. Shes better with words than me. But if theres such thing as a platonic soulmate, Emme is that. Shes the first person I send anything. My God, absolutely anything: I want to try this video game, I want to try this recipe, I want to try this restaurant, so youre going with me. I have a favorite podcast called The Old Gods of Appalachia. Emmes never even heard of it. But theyre having a show tonight, and shes coming along. Weve been roommates for seven years. Its the first time Ive ever lived in a home where I was allowed to speak up about things that bothered me. Emme taught me how to do the friend call-out. You know, like: Youre my best friend. But what youre doing is really fucking shitty. The first time it happened, it was a big oh yeah moment for me. Like, oh yeah: theres a way to talk about hard things without yelling at each other, or ignoring each other. Shes helped me work through a lot of stuff. And Ive tried to help her with some things too. Shes not exactly where she wants to be right now; sometimes she blames herself. Its like, girl, youre the hardest worker I know; its obviously the fucking job market. She also has no idea how pretty she is. Its like, girl, are you seeing what Im seeing? Then one time she actually said: Im not that fun. Not that fun? Girl, you light up a fucking room.” 2. “Whenever there was an event at school, hed come straight from work. Wearing these heavy blue coveralls. Stomping around in these big, chunky boots. Hed have a tag with his name on it: Herbie, written big like. He was always so noticeable. Thats the main thing I remember: the other parents seemed smaller. Maybe not smaller, but sleeker: tight button-tops, khakis. I was one of two Hispanic kids in my grade. Id only gotten in through a program that sends black and brown kids to private school. But I never felt discriminated against. We all loved the same video games and YouTube videos. Within a few weeks I was going to friends houses for sleepovers. These houses were humongous. Everyone had their own rooms. Then Id go back to our house, in the Hispanic neighborhood. And it was just a square with a triangle roof. And we had like ten people living there. It was different. Behind closed doors, I knew we were different. And that juxtaposition was a little too much to overcome in my head. I felt like if I wanted to fully step into this new role, I needed to shed all that. Im on the other side of it now. I graduated from a private university. Im working at a tech start-up. I feel like this was it. When my parents came over, this was their intention. Ive fully assimilated. But now that Im here, I kinda miss what Ive left behind. Ive lost it. Its not that I chose another culture. My life just got filled with other stuff, and I let it go by the wayside. I dont even really speak Spanish anymore. Maybe in very small bursts, or whatever. But I miss the curse words, the slang. I miss it being commonplace. Mainly I just miss being around people like me: feature wise, and stuff like that. At least now that Im in New York, I can take the train home every other weekend. Its like a celebration, every time I come back. We dont all live together anymore; but the whole familys nearby. Everyone comes over. My dad grills out: steak, tortillas, vegetables. Eating home cooked food, its like Im a kid again. Its healing in a way. It feels right. Knowing Im in a good spot. Ive gotten to where I want to be, but Im back with the people that Ive always been with.”",

          "summary": "Well, this is one of the best lifestyle blogs for women. The blogger covers style, design, food, relationship, travel, and even motherhood. After writing for various blogs, Joanna started her blog as a weekend hobby getting most of her stories through life experience, Cup of Jo became among the best blogs covering women issues.",
          "content": "I recently went shopping at a big-box store with my six-year-old son. He is a devout saver, and he was ready to spend some of his riches. Though I had my doubts, he was committed to spending a whopping $17.99 on a mechanical snake. He proudly carried it to check out, wallet in hand. His math skills — addition, skip-counting and subtraction — were on full display, as was my smile.After showering him with compliments, the woman behind the counter asked him what he wanted to do when he grew up. The question, as it turns out, was rhetorical. She answered it as quickly as she asked it, having narrowed his future to two possibilities: “A basketball player or football player?”I countered her suggestions with alternate careers one could suggest to a child who just demonstrated impressive math skills: Teacher? Architect? Engineer? I wish I could say I was surprised by her suggestions. Its likely how she viewed success for him; the prevailing perspective by many in our society remains limited regarding the opportunities for success for Black people, especially Black men.While its true my children play sports (ice hockey for my daughter and soccer and ice hockey for my son), my husband and I encourage them to do so because of the life lessons they will gain: showing up for others, working as a team, giving something your all, and picking yourself up after setbacks. They dont play sports with any career aspirations — which is good because the chances of playing professional sports are similar to getting struck by lightning. In fact, while they both love sports, my daughter has her eyes set on being a food critic or chocolate taste tester; and, after getting behind the wheel on a trip to Legoland, my son plans to be a race car driver.When my children were born, I was filled with excitement — but worry, as well. Like many Black parents, I walk a tightrope to make sure my children are aware of the world we live in, but not weighed down by it. I flashed forward to when my son would be old enough to take a solo trip to the store, and wondered if, in 15 years, that walk would be safe? I thought about when both kids would be old enough to drive and hoped that, by the time they turned 16, cars would fly, maybe making it safer than driving while Black. And, I hoped for them that they would be able to live their fullest lives and play active roles in their destinies.Having children has made me more acutely aware of the dearth of representation families are still grappling with. Of the 3,190 books published in 2021 in the United States received by the Cooperative Childrens Book Center (CCBC), only 439 had significant representation of Black/African characters, subjects, or topics.* Most of those are focused on our history and culture. These books are incredibly important, and we have a lot of them in our home. However, it is also important for all our children to see people of color in books that mirror their own lives and imagination. Books that are not primarily about race or historical struggles but about wonder and joy.I didnt explicitly say anything to the woman at the check-out counter about her short-sightedness. I know she sees examples of Black excellence every day. I know that my son showed her what hes already capable of at age six and offered a glimpse of what he will be able to do one day. My dream for my children is that they will find careers that make them happy and self-sufficient, and I hope the society they live in gives them the space and vision to figure that out.",

(New Yorker)Why we speak more weirdly at home. “Many of us have a secret language, the private lexicon of our home life. Sometimes known as familects, invented words, pet names, in-jokes, and personal memes swirl and emerge from the mess of lives spent in close quarters. During the pandemic, weve spent dramatically more time in those quarters, and our in-group slang has changed accordingly.” (The Atlantic)Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a new podcast where she interviews older women.A reality show Id actually watch.Who else is on a chickpea kick?
